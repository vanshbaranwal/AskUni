## 📌 Introduction  
Today college staff spend hours answering the same queries **when is the last date of fee submission??, from where to get the timetables??, scholarship forms, and admission details**. Most of these information are trapped in PDFs, circulars, or notice boards.  

Students, especially those more comfortable in **Hindi, Rajasthani or regional languages** face long queues, delays and confusion just to get the simple information.  

**AskUni solves this** with an **AI-powered multilingual chatbot** trained on **college-specific data**. It delivers instant, verified answers — in the student’s own language.
